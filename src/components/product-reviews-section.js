      "We‚Äôre always looking for ways to reduce waste and work more sustainably, so we‚Äôre excited to start using our new NFC-enabled business cards from V1CE.Instead of handing out printed cards, our team now use a single, reusable digital card that shares their contact details instantly with a tap or QR code scan. No more stacks of paper cards - just simple, smart networking that cuts down on waste.Not only does this reduce paper use, it also means we can update details in real time, so we‚Äôre always sharing accurate information with clients and contacts.A small step, but another move towards more sustainable, efficient ways of working.",

      "I‚Äôve worked in creative production for over a decade, so I‚Äôve seen more networking gimmicks than I can count. The V1CE card looks impressive and always gets a comment, but that‚Äôs just the opener. The real value lies in what happens after someone taps it.The software does the follow-up for me. It captures leads, syncs with my CRM, and even lets me pre-load content I want people to see. I‚Äôve gone from handing out cards and hoping people call, to knowing they already saved me, saw my reel, and have a meeting link in their inbox.That shift in workflow from hopeful to proactive is what makes this a staple in my kit now.",

      "I am a Heating & Plumbing engineer, in and out of houses all day, forever getting asked for business cards, which are easily lost. The V1CE card has been a real game changer, clients can now save my contact card with all my information on which has also got a direct link to my google review page. Ive seen some reviews saying it was difficult to set up, Id personally disagree but thats just my opinion.",

I love that you can adjust what link people get any time you like. What a great idea. I wont turn back after using this, super happy customer. Also it looks great and was made so quickly. I really appreciate all the videos demonstrating how to use the card too. Its very well considered.",

      "This is not only a great product that works flawlessly, it impresses EVERYONE who sees it in action. But even more impressive is the support team at V1CE, they are unequalled and go out of their way to assure customer satisfaction and provide technical assistance at every stage if you need it.  My company now uses more than 17 (black metal) cards and I'm certain we will be offering more.  Congrats to a great company, with a great product, and a great team.",

      "I‚Äôm a property consultant. I build funnels, I track conversions, I measure every inch of a customer journey. I say this with zero exaggeration: the automated follow-up inside V1CE is one of the most profitable tools I‚Äôve used this year.I connected it to my calendar and CRM. Every time someone taps my card or scans the table talker at an event, they‚Äôre not just getting my info they‚Äôre receiving a personalised email from me 30 minutes later, with a call link and tailored next steps.",

Adding my V1CE card to my Apple Wallet might sound like a small feature, but it‚Äôs had a big impact.Now, even when I forget my physical card, I‚Äôm still ready.
