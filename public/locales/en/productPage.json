          "question": "How do NFC business cards work?",
          "answer": "NFC (Near Field Communication) cards contain a small chip that can wirelessly transmit information to compatible smartphones. When you tap your Mibio card on an NFC-enabled phone, your digital profile instantly appears on their screen, allowing them to save your contact details or access your links with a single tap. For phones without NFC, a QR code on the back of the card can be scanned."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need an app to use the card?",
          "answer": "No, neither you nor the person receiving your information needs an app to use the Mibio card. Your digital profile opens directly in their phone's web browser. This makes sharing seamless and accessible to everyone."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will this card work on all phones?",
          "answer": "Mibio cards are compatible with most modern smartphones. All iPhones (XR, XS, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and newer) have native NFC reading capabilities. Most Android phones released after 2012 are NFC-enabled. For older phones or those without NFC, a QR code on the back of the card can be scanned using any camera app."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I add my card to Apple Wallet or Google Wallet?",
          "answer": "While Mibio cards don't directly integrate with Apple Wallet or Google Wallet like payment cards, your digital profile can be saved as a contact in their phone's address book. This ensures your information is always accessible and easy to find."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can someone without NFC still view my card?",
          "answer": "Yes! Every Mibio card comes with a unique QR code printed on the back. If a phone doesn't have NFC capabilities, or if the user prefers, they can simply scan the QR code with their camera to access your digital profile."
