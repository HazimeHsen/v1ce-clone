Instead of handing out printed cards, our team now use a single, reusable digital card that shares their contact details instantly with a tap or QR code scan. No more stacks of paper cards - just simple, smart networking that cuts down on waste. Not only does this reduce paper use, it also means we can update details in real time, so we're always sharing accurate information with clients and contacts. A small step, but another move towards more sustainable, efficient ways of working."

The Mibio card looks impressive and always gets a comment, but that's just the opener. The real value lies in what happens after someone taps it. The software does the follow-up for me. It captures leads, syncs with my CRM, and even lets me pre-load content I want people to see. I've gone from handing out cards and hoping people call, to knowing they already saved me, saw my reel, and have a meeting link in their inbox. That shift in workflow from hopeful to proactive is what makes this a staple in my kit now."
